Python based Banking System

This a Banking system made using Python and uses files to store the data and retriving the information.
In this i have mostly used the pickle module to store and reload the data from the files. It made it 
very easy by its dump and load function.
And more over i have created a dictionary to store the basic information like info,pin and transfer details.
and this can be checked in the class bank.


If you are running this on your pc. Please create two files that have been used.
